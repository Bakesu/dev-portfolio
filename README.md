## About Me
Hi, I'm Bekir Tekmen, a passionate Cand.Scient in IT-Product Development. I specialize in software development, product innovation, and creating research-driven tech solutions.

I believe in building meaningful, user-centered products that solve real-world problems. My approach is both structured and iterative—whether I'm prototyping, developing software, or tackling a complex system design, I always prioritize delivering high-quality, scalable, and efficient solutions. Agile methodologies, user-focused design, and continuous learning drive my development process.

I'm experienced with a range of technologies, including Java, C#, TypeScript, React, .NET, and Go for full-stack and distributed systems. I'm also passionate about modern engineering practices like CI/CD, Git workflows, DevOps, and Cloud Computing, which help me create robust and reliable applications. My portfolio here reflects a diverse set of projects—from cloud-based solutions to software prototypes and cutting-edge research initiatives.
This repository showcases software prototypes, cloud-based solutions, and research projects, reflecting my ability to design and implement innovative IT solutions.
