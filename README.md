## About Me
Hi, I'm Bekir Tekmen, a passionate Cand.Scient in IT-Product Development. I specialize in software and product development, with a focus on creating innovative and user-centered solutions. This repository highlights some of the projects I worked on during my studies. For inquiries about my experience as a student programmer or my independent projects, feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bekir-tekmen-ab0629212/) or [get in touch with me](#contact-me).

I believe in building meaningful, user-centered products that solve real-world problems. My approach is both structured and iterative. Whether I'm prototyping, developing software, or tackling a complex system design, I always prioritize delivering high-quality, scalable, and efficient solutions. Agile methodologies, user-focused design, and continuous learning drive my development process.

I'm experienced with a range of technologies, including Java, C#, TypeScript, React, .NET, and Go for full-stack and distributed systems. I'm also passionate about modern engineering practices like CI/CD, Git workflows, DevOps, and Cloud Computing. 
This repository showcases software prototypes, cloud-based solutions, and research projects, reflecting my ability to design and implement innovative IT solutions.
